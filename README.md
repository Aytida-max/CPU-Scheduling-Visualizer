## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Interactive Process Management:** Add, remove, and customize processes with specific arrival and burst times.
-   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from multiple key scheduling algorithms to compare their behavior.
-   **Dynamic Gantt Chart:** See a real-time visualization of how processes are executed on the CPU.
-   **Performance Statistics:** Automatically calculates and displays metrics like Finish Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time for each process.
-   **Clean & Responsive UI:** A modern interface that works smoothly on different screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms Implemented

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of the following algorithms:

-   **Round Robin (RR):** A preemptive, fair-share scheduling algorithm using a time quantum.
-   **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT):** The preemptive version of Shortest Job Next, optimal for minimizing average waiting time.
-   **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN):** A non-preemptive algorithm designed to prevent starvation by considering both waiting time and burst time.
